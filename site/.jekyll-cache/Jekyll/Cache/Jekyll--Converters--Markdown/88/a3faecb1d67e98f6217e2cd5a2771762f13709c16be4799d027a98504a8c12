<p>I was a part of Virtual Symposium lead by Intel and CBSE which was a 5 dayâ€™s global programme meant to teach everyone AI ethics and showcase 10 best projects from the country and one project was of my own ie AI-Health Assistant.
There were a total of 15 students which were selected to showcase their projects and guide hundreds of other aspiring students.

<p>During this event, I received hundreds of messages from students from all over the World, about my project and to guide them as well. I guided those students and provided the material that would be enough to learn Deep Learning. Intel and CBSE also created an World Record during this event.</p>
