I was provided with the oppurtunity to step further in my AI quest by being a part of the CBSE-Intel AI for youth Virtual Apprenticeship Program. This program was driven by National Youth Council, Singapore.
A total of 20 students were selected , 10-10 each from India and Singapore respectively.

## What We Did:-

 - Worked in collaboration with youth of Singapore and created unique social impact solutions.
 -   Met and heard from industry experts on various topics. The Best experts I felt were founders of **Buzz-Ar and Mercurious**.
 - Got insights and advice from tech experts in projects.
 - Experienced Singapore culture through virtual tours and communication with the country's youngsters.

We made an AI-based Food Serving recommender which was one of the best solutions with fantastic UI and speed.
It was made to solve the problem of over-eating which is common in today's generation.
