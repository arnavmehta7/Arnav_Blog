Finally, The Best moments of my life. A total of 100 students were selected from all over India from the thousands of Applicants and I proved to be the right person by being selected for this programme.

## How it Happened?
* I started learning to code few months before this programme. A beloved Sir in my contacts helped me a lot to learn. I am all due to him.
* The programme started , and I gave the tests to get selected.
* I was shortlisted and hence a interview was conducted online and YES!, I passed!

The classes happened 6 days a week and 3hours everyday. I didn't skipped a single session for the total duration!
## What Happened in It? ðŸ˜ƒ 
* For 1 Week, we were taught about the Project Cycle, AI-ethics, AI-tools, Libraries, Applications in real life and more basics.
* Then the real work stated , we started to have sessions based on Coding, starting straight from Scikit-learn (Normal ML) and ending towards the complex,almighty Deep learning with tensorflow
* We were given weekly projects and we had to complete them in due time and submit, due to so much work in the end only 20 stuents remained out of the hundred ðŸ¤¯, I am glad that I made myself into one of them.
* There
* Then the journey was done, Now it was time for the real work ie making **Our Own Projects!**

## What I learnt?
* AI, ofcourse the sessions were all about AI and I grasped more than what was taught by exploring things on my own.
* I learnt public speaking, because at some time, students were asked to volunteer and then speak what they understand from the code and explain it to everyone else, I was a poor speaker at that time and such speaking boosted my speaking, listening and writing skills to another level!
* I learnt Team work because some of the weekly tasks were to be done in teams, and I had various partners who worked with me.
* Time Managment, due to high work load from school and then 3 hours extra classes along with tutions , I had to put an extra force to make sure I do well in all of them, and yeah I Did!
* I also learnt few extra things like advanced parts of Opencv, Tensorflow, Transfer Learning and Scikit-Learn.
