  <p>Sleep is an important facet of our daily life. All metabolic, physiologic and psychiatric  processes depends on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has goals in life that they want to acheive, due to this we adapt an hardcore lifestyle, give up sleep and instead using that time for working, But itâ€™s an terrifying act one do to his body.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Lack of sleep has been found to be in synchronization with developing Alzheimerâ€™s, lack of creativity, focus, energy, will power, decision-making, learning, poor memory, mental health and more!</p>

<p>Yes most do, sleep is necessary for the body. During sleep the neurochemical pathways clean, re-form themselves, mylein sheath develops on neurons, body heals, cells develop, things regulate, and the brain calms down again and becomes better than earlier. After a solid sleep the new formed neurons and the other boosted neurons due to mylein sheath starts to work faster and hence the productivity or the same things that those neurons are put to work in becomes faster.</p>

<p>We have seen above the benefits of sleep, lack of sleep may leads into sleep dept which in turn disrupts many vital processes and cause change in behaviour. Some people say that they now can sleep for few hours only and still keep nailing things, but in reality due to less sleep time their bodies have adapted to only do the <strong>Vital Things</strong> which are most necessary for living while sleeping and miss out the other tasks, it doesnâ€™t mean that the other tasks of body that are skipped are not important. Each process is important, if not performed then it can cause low life span, alternation of behaviour, focus depletion and other things which one doesnâ€™t wants.</p>

<p>Sleeping restocks the mental energy used during the day, the muscles tired due to work, the cells died during the day, neural pathways chemicals that got depleted and many things that we donâ€™t know yet.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>According to researches the sleep was there, before there was any brain formed in a creature. For such small creatures if sleep is necessary, then it must be the same for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a creature called squirt , which is a very basic organism that is studied to identify the things happened before brain in evolution. It has no brain , but still it sleeps; this shows the extreme significance of sleep in our life.
