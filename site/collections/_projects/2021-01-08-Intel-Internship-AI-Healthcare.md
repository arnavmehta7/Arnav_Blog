My First Social impact project was AI-Healthcare which is explained in the following image
![Project](/collections/projects_images/healthcare_overview.jpg){: width='1200' height:100%}

My Project was a web-based application that takes chest X-Ray images as input and helps to detect if there is any disease. In the background when the image is uploaded The
AI-based 5 layered Neural Network Model trained on thousands of
samples identifies the key features in the image to detect the disease, It
can identify multiple diseases effectively with an accuracy of 90%.
It was also featured on Multiple platforms like instagram,twitter etc.
The shooting of the project was done at my own home due to Corona Virus.
