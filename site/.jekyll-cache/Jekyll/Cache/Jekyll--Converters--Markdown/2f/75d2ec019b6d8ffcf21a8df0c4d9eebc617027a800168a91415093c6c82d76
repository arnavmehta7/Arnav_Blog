<h2 id="my-project-ai-parking-buzzer">My Project: AI-Parking Buzzer</h2>
<p>My family used to face a lot of problems due to parking of vehicles outside our house premises and front of the gates, hence it used to cause lots of difficulties to take our conveyance‚Äôs outside and inside the house.
On a pleasant evening with heavy muddled thoughts. I realized that I can create an ‚ÄúAI-Based Buzzer‚Äù which automatically starts beeping as soon as any sort of vehicle is parked in the Application‚Äôs frame. I started exploring various libraries in python which would help me create this, after dozen hours of coding, I managed to create a much better AI-Model with the help of Teachable Machine it was much faster and better than I could have ever made with coding from scratch. Dataset was a big issue I couldn‚Äôt find satisfactory data hence I took initiative on my own and went out of my house with a camera running through the streets getting images, after almost 500 I used an API which helped me to get thousands of more. The AI-Model reached more than 98% accuracy, then I created a python-based Website that did what I wanted BUT it was slow, it was so slow that it took a minute to just obtain the frames from the camera. This made me feel like there is some tyrant in python trying to make me lose.</p>

<p>I thought again, Drank some coffee, and started working on the same project but now this time with the mighty Javascript which I last time used almost half an year ago, I quickly read docs of Tensorflow.js, learned async, checked articles, audio-libraries, went to StackOverflow copied some code and finally, I made an extremely fast website and added my Voice into it so that as soon as there was a prediction of a vehicle with more than 90% accuracy it started Beeping. It is smart enough to determine if there is any object, humans, or other things in the frame.
Thus I was able to solve one of the most renowned problems of my society along with winning the <strong>Challenge of  the year!</strong>.</p>
